        <p class="mb-4">
          Go (囲碁), also known as Baduk (바둑) in Korean or Weiqi (围棋) in
          Chinese, is an ancient board game that combines strategy, intuition,
          and creativity. With simple rules but profound complexity, Go has
          captivated players for thousands of years.
